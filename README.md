I'm excited to share a recent project where we leveraged deep learning to create a flower classification model. This project is a significant step forward in applying artificial intelligence to image recognition, and it was both a challenging and rewarding experience.

Project Overview:
Using TensorFlow and Keras, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of classifying images of flowers into five distinct categories: daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip. The model was trained on a robust dataset, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.
 Key Features:
Model Architecture: Built using TensorFlow and Keras, our CNN model boasts impressive accuracy in classifying flower images.
User Interface: Implemented using Streamlit, the app provides an intuitive interface where users can upload an image and get real-time predictions.
Real-Time Predictions: The model delivers immediate feedback, indicating the type of flower and the confidence level of the prediction.
 How It Works:
Image Upload: Users can upload images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG formats.
Image Processing: The uploaded image is resized and preprocessed for model prediction.
Prediction: The model predicts the class of the flower and displays the result along with the confidence percentage.

Technical Details:
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Streamlit, NumPy
Model: Pre-trained CNN model fine-tuned for flower classification
Deployment: Interactive web application using Streamlit
I'm proud of the hard work and dedication that went into this project. Feel free to check it out and provide your feedback!
